The report concluded that employees who had sought treatment in their past for mental health conditions tended to work in developed countries and states with big technology firms in the United States. They also might have family history and held the belief that mental health conditions interfered with their work. Their companies provided resources, options and benefits for mental health care. Therefore, management of technology firms should provide various options and benefits of mental health care. A better environment for employees to express their feeling while protecting their anonymity should be offered.
