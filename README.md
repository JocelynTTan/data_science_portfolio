# Data Science Portfolio
Portfolio of Data Analysis Projects completed for academic, research and self-learning purposes. Presented in the form of Notebooks.

1. 	Mental Health in Technology Industry (Individual Project)

The analysis concluded that employees who had sought treatment in their past for mental health conditions tended to work in developed countries and states with big technology firms in the United States. They also might have family history and held the belief that mental health conditions interfered with their work. Their companies provided resources, options and benefits for mental health care. Therefore, management of technology firms should provide various options and benefits of mental health care. A better environment for employees to express their feeling while protecting their anonymity should be offered.

Language: Python, R 

Time Period: May 2019 – June 2019
	
•	Identify the strongest predictors of mental health illness in the tech industry and the geographical variation using Logistic Regression, K-Nearest-Neighbors, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. 

•	Pre-process survey data with over 25 text variables which have multiple levels with over 1000 records


2. Statistical Investigation of Twitter Firestorm Response Strategies (Individual Project)

Twitter has been a great platform for word-of-mouth propagation, which makes it one of the major social media for marketing campaign and communication. However, the speed of propagation sometimes can make the brand image of a company in jeopardy by bringing huge waves of negative comments and complaints with outrage in a short period of time. In the study of Pfeffer et al. (2014) , it defined the sudden influx of messages with huge amount of negative word-of-mouth and complaints towards companies in social media as online firestorm. A statistical investigation on an online firestorm of JPMorgan in 2013 was conducted in this study in order to examine the effectiveness of the response provided by the company.  Sentiment analysis was utilized to extract the sentiment from tweets and sentiment difference before and after the response was tested by statistical tests. Two sentiment analysis tools were used to compare the results. After observing significant increase in negative sentiments and decrease in positive sentiment from the two different tools, the study concluded that the response was not very effective.

Language: Python, R         

Time Period: Jan 2019 – June 2019

•	Retrieved and cleaned over 10k historical tweets for sentiment analysis using text mining packages

•	Built Python functions using statistical tests to identify the sentiment difference before and after response

3. Advance Data Analysis on Players of National Basketball Association  (Team Project)

The NBA Player Social Power dataset has 446 cases, representing players in the league and social power is measured across 38 variables. Five analytical techniques were used to analyze these characteristics of player performance. These techniques included Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Common Factor Analysis (CFA), Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), Clustering Analysis and Ridge Regression. Common threads reflective of offensive and defensive performance indicators were highlighted across multiple analyses. This suggests that these indicators reflect important underlying performance statistics for NBA players. Further analysis is required to extend the analyses and find further insights as to player performance.

Language: R         

Time Period: Feb 2019 – Mar 2019                                                                                                                                                                                              
•	Dealt with over 100 missing value in the dataset with large number of features representing players performance

•	Revealed two-factor theoretical model based on over 10 performance features by confirmatory factor analysis

•	Conducted Cluster Analysis and successfully segmented NBA players (98% NBA stars identified in one cluster)
