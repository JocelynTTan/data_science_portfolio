1. 	Mental Health in Technology Industry

The analysis concluded that employees who had sought treatment in their past for mental health conditions tended to work in developed countries and states with big technology firms in the United States. They also might have family history and held the belief that mental health conditions interfered with their work. Their companies provided resources, options and benefits for mental health care. Therefore, management of technology firms should provide various options and benefits of mental health care. A better environment for employees to express their feeling while protecting their anonymity should be offered.

2. Statistical Investigation of Twitter Firestorm Response Strategies  

Twitter has been a great platform for word-of-mouth propagation, which makes it one of the major social media for marketing campaign and communication. However, the speed of propagation sometimes can make the brand image of a company in jeopardy by bringing huge waves of negative comments and complaints with outrage in a short period of time. In the study of Pfeffer et al. (2014) , it defined the sudden influx of messages with huge amount of negative word-of-mouth and complaints towards companies in social media as online firestorm. A statistical investigation on an online firestorm of JPMorgan in 2013 was conducted in this study in order to examine the effectiveness of the response provided by the company.  Sentiment analysis was utilized to extract the sentiment from tweets and sentiment difference before and after the response was tested by statistical tests. Two sentiment analysis tools were used to compare the results. After observing significant increase in negative sentiments and decrease in positive sentiment from the two different tools, the study concluded that the response was not very effective.
